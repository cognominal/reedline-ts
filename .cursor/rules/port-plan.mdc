2. [ ] Convert Rust test syntax to Jest/Vitest
3. [ ] Adapt test data and assertions
4. [ ] Ensure equivalent test coverage
5. [ ] Add TypeScript-specific tests

---

## Key Technical Considerations

### Unicode Handling
- [ ] Use Node.js built-in Unicode support
- [ ] Implement grapheme cluster handling
- [ ] Ensure proper cursor positioning
- [ ] Test with complex Unicode characters

### Terminal Compatibility
- [ ] Use `node:readline` or similar for input
- [ ] Implement ANSI escape sequence handling
- [ ] Support different terminal types
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize for JavaScript engine characteristics
- [ ] Use efficient data structures
- [ ] Minimize memory allocations
- [ ] Profile and optimize bottlenecks

### Type Safety
- [ ] Leverage TypeScript's type system
- [ ] Use strict type checking
- [ ] Implement runtime validation where needed
- [ ] Maintain type safety throughout

---

## Development Workflow

### Incremental Development
- [ ] Start with core, testable components
- [ ] Build up complexity gradually
- [ ] Maintain working state throughout
- [ ] Regular integration testing

### Test-Driven Development
- [ ] Write tests before implementation
- [ ] Port tests alongside code
- [ ] Ensure regression prevention
- [ ] Maintain high test coverage

### Documentation
- [ ] Maintain JSDoc comments
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document API changes
- [ ] Keep README updated

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Regular code reviews
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Cross-platform testing

---

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All core reedline functionality working
- [ ] Full test coverage maintained
- [ ] Performance within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Working examples

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Input latency < 16ms
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB for typical usage
- [ ] Startup time < 100ms
- [ ] No significant performance regressions

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Unicode handling complexity**: Start with basic Unicode support, add complexity incrementally
- **Terminal compatibility**: Test on multiple platforms early
- **Performance issues**: Profile regularly and optimize bottlenecks
- **Memory leaks**: Use memory profiling tools and test long-running sessions

### Project Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to the phased approach
- **Testing gaps**: Maintain test coverage throughout
- **Documentation debt**: Document as you go
- **Integration issues**: Regular integration testing

- **Phase 3-4**: Edit modes and history (4 weeks)
- **Phase 5-6**: Completion and menus (4 weeks)
- **Phase 7-8**: Painting and advanced features (4 weeks)
