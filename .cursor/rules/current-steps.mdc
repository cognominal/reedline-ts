# Reedline TypeScript Port Development Short-term workflow

This is an extract from the main plan that specifes items to accomplish according to the short term workflow defined in step-workflow.mdc



#### Basic Line Buffer
- [x] Port `core_editor/line_buffer.rs` â†’ `core/line-buffer.ts`
- [x] Implement core functionality:
  - [x] Basic text storage and cursor management
  - [x] Character insertion/deletion
  - [x] Cursor movement (left/right)
  - [x] Word movement (partially working - needs Unicode fixes)
  - [x] Line operations (partially working - needs logic fixes)
- [x] Port all existing Rust tests to TypeScript
- [x] Add edge case tests for Unicode handling

**Status**: Partially complete. Core functionality implemented with 73% test pass rate. Need to fix Unicode word boundary detection, case operations, swap operations, and line movement logic.
