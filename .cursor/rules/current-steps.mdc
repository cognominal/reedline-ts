# Reedline TypeScript Port Development Sort term Plan


This is a extract of port-plan.mdc that represent the steps we are currently implementing.
Implement items one by one and mark them as done when done. Ask for confirmation before proceeding to the next item

Update port-plan.mdc only when all items are done.
Then replace the #### .mdc section here by the next one in port-plan.mdc


#### Core Types & Enums
- [ ] Port `enums.rs` â†’ `types.ts`:
  - [ ] `Signal` enum (Success, CtrlC, CtrlD)
  - [ ] `EditCommand` enum (all editing actions)
  - [ ] `ReedlineEvent` enum (all events)
  - [ ] `EditType` and `UndoBehavior` enums
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for all enums and types
